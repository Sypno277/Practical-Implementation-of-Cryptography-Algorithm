# Cryptography Algorithm Implementation

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of various cryptography algorithms.  
It is designed for learning purposes and can be used to understand how encryption and decryption techniques work in practice.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `main.py` (or similar) – Entry point for running the algorithms.
- `modules/` – Contains different cryptography algorithms.
- `venv/` – Virtual environment (ignore for understanding the code).

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Create/activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
